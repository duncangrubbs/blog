Like engineering, QA testing is a skill. Some engineers are good at it, some are mediocre, and some are bad. But that's beside the point. Engineers should focus on engineering, not on QA testing. It's not that we shouldn't understand how the application works, or what the expected behavior is. It's just that QA testing requires a context switch, an entirely different headspace.

Often times engineers work in small chunks of work. This way of working allows you to heavily focus on one small part of the application without worrying about the impact on the rest of it. In theory, a well tested codebase should do the rest and ensure you have not impacted anything else. However, many codebases are not well tested and require human QA. While I believe that peer QA testing is an important part of the review process, I do not believe that it is enough to ensure there are no regressions, and therefore additional QA is neccesary.
